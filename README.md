# [Project 1: Quora-Question-Similarity: Project Overview](https://github.com/vaibhavt14/Quora-Question-Similarity) 
* It is a binary classification problem, for a given pair of questions we need to predict if they are duplicate or not.
* Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked.
* This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered.
* We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not.  
* Optimized Logistic Regressor,Linear SVM, and XGBoost to reach the best model. 
* Performance metrics: log-loss

# [Project 2: Personalized-Cancer-Diagosis: Project Overview](https://github.com/vaibhavt14/Personalized-Cancer-Diagosis)
* Personalized Medicine Redefining Cancer Treatment is a real world data set from Kaggle
* Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) launched this competition, accepted by the NIPS 2017 Competition Track, because we need your help to take personalized medicine     to its full potential
* Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.
* Optimized Naive Bayes,Logistic Regression,Linear SVM and Random Forest Regressors to reach the best model.
